# Lazy trainer

Lazy-Trainer, is a web app that simplifies the approach to physical activity for those who are particularly lazy🤓

Through your account, you will be able to see and interact with your circuit and keep track of individual activities during execution.

Obviously you have to put the tenacity, the resistance and the condition! 💪

The methods of use are 2:

- 🏋️‍♀️Self-taught: creating your own circuit independently.
- 🤼‍♂️From trainer and trainer: by associating a trainer to your account, you can run the circuit that a trainer has assigned you.

The features currently available are:

- ⛓view your weekly plan
- 📄 creation of activities in a simple way
- ⏱ keep track of the times for the activities to be performed
- 🤝 trainer association

## Goals

The project aims to be a tool that can be used by anyone who wants to improve their physical acitivity. The project is not intended to be a replacement for a personal trainer it help him/her to get in touch with you, but rather a tool that can be used to improve the physical activity of those who are not particularly lazy🤓.
